The launch of the fall detector is going to be beneficial for all the mobile phone users. Because it gives protection to the users when they hit into an accident or something unusual. Fall detector has taken a lot of heat for the safety measures of the public. Normally, people who come in 15 to 80 age group use their own cell phones and by installing the fall detector, it highlights everything that sucks about the provision on their way. The main value that the customer gets from the fall detector application is its convenient usage for free. It also acts as the unique selling proposition of our

product. Unlike other similar products or devices available in the market, this application can be installed in any smartphones, irrespective of the Operating System, at free of cost without any limitations to the services provided. Fundamentally, this application helps or protects the customer in their daily lives without any cost. On the other hand, as the service provider, we get money from each download of the application as well as from the small advertises in the application. As a responsible citizen, by providing this application for a customer at free of cost, I am becoming a part of community service, where everyone can be safe and happy in their own way.
