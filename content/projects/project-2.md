The mobile phone users can easily download my application from the App Store for free cost when they find the app is useful. From the various advertisements of the product, they may get noticed and can download.  
It can be sold as a preinstalled app in wearable devices and mobile phones.

Most of my income comes from the number per downloads and the small cookies show in between videos.  
For my product, it is hard to have a regular conversation, which is the best way to gain a good relationship with every consumer. So, what I can do is ask for feedback on the product. The feedback and complaints will be received through the app website. Customers can also call a toll-free number which is given on the website for complaints. From this feedback, I can update the App to overcome its drawbacks.

Showing appreciation in the way of reward long-time customers also helps me to make a bond with the customers. Moreover, I also try to make valuable content with the clients.

To reach out to my target customers, I prefer social media like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc for advertising my App, cause most of the people are in action in such media.  
Build partner up with various mobile phone companies like Samsung, Apple, etc and make it a preinstalled app.

By knowing the target audience, I can easily pass my message to the consumers.  
I listen to the customer feedbacks and satisfy their needs, correct the drawbacks and make the App convenient.
