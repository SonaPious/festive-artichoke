1\. UNCERTAINTY  
The very concept of fall detection is currently available in the market. Though not, in the same way, I am proposing it. So, until and otherwise come with the further strategic modifications or innovations to the product, there is a high risk for my product for being confronted with strategic risk soon.

2\. DEVELOPMENT Of SIMILAR APPLICATIONS  
The fall detector is going to develop in an open-source platform, it is easy for others to develop a similar or updated version of a fall detector. What they only need to copyright the fall detector. There are possible ways to raise applications like fall detector So, it affects the credibility of the application and people always choose better and updated technologies.

3\. UNKNOWNS FALLS AND WRONG INFORMATION CAN BE SENT  
The detector detects every fall of the phones. When a cell phone falls unknowingly by the user, the user cannot react to the vibration and it will send undesired information to the emergency medical service. This will result in the immediate action of the medical team. But their action is going to be meaningless and they waste their valuable time to help somebody else who is exactly facing any crucial situation.

4\. EXISTENCE OF WEARABLE SENSORS

To monitor the mobility, accelerometers and gyroscopes are used in fall detector systems. But studies report that the comfort of wearable sensors is important in fall detection and it also gives more accuracy in sensor a fall.  
Also, seniors prefer wearable sensors like watches and body attachable devices for detecting falls instead of carrying cell phones. Such devices can also measure the level of blood pressure and hypertension of the body.

5\. CHALLENGES FROM PHONE ACCESSORIES  
There are plenty of safety phone cases with extra hardcovers available in the market, which can prevail in the app from determining the accuracy of the fall. So, to make the application with more accurate sensors is also a technological risk that must be overcome.

6\. PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONCERN  
Fall detector always asks for certain details about the users at the time of installing the application. That includes name, address, age, details of the guardian, health and it also access the location, wherever the user goes. This matters a few of the users because people these days are not wanting to reveal their identity and other relating information to others. It also makes easy access to hackers. Thus, people probably hesitate to download and use the fall detector.  
The possible amendments in the existing privacy laws in the coming years can affect the existence of an operation of the application.

7\. FINANCIAL AGENDA AND TEAM ORGANIZATION

My product has something to do more with social responsibility, it is my responsibility to divide the revenue between social causes, business developments, and personal benefits in a proper way.  
By creating a proper agenda about channelizing financial resources as well as the revenues effectively with team members having a proper vision, there is a high chance of being met with financial risk.
